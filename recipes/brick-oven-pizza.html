        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias. Best accompanied by ice-cold, pilsner-style lager beer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 Cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Toppings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Warm water into a large bowl, sprinkle yeast overtop. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour 1 cup at at time until incorporated</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours.</li>
            <li>Prep pizzas: Remove dough from fridge one hour prior to using</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowerst rack, to 550 degrees F. Lightly dust pizza peel with flour</li>
            <li>Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel</li>
            <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza. Then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the top.</li>
            <li>Use a quick jerk to make sure dough will release from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the stone and place pizza on stone.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes</li>
            <li>Slike the pizza onto peel and remove from oven. Sprinkle basil, cut into slices, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
